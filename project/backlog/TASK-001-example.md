# Implement analysis dataset export

## Goal

Create a deterministic export of the analysis dataset that can be reused by downstream notebooks.

## Context

The project requires a stable dataset export so all analytical workflows operate on the same data snapshot.

## Touchpoints

- `src/<package_name>/`
- `tests/unit/`

## Scope

- implement dataset export function
- write dataset to file (e.g. csv or parquet)
- include basic metadata (timestamp, version)
- ensure deterministic output for same input

## Out of Scope

- data visualization
- model training
- advanced transformations

## Done

- [ ] dataset export function exists
- [ ] output file is created correctly
- [ ] metadata is included
- [ ] output is deterministic
- [ ] tests added or updated

## Validation

- Run: `poetry run pytest`
- Verify: export creates file with expected structure
- Verify: repeated runs produce identical output

## Notes

- prefer simple format (csv is sufficient)
- keep implementation minimal
